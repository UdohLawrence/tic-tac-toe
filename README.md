# Learn React Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe

### React + Vite

This is a rendition of the Learn React Tutorial, as seen on the [official React](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) Site. An interactive tic-tac-toe game was built with **_React + Vite_**.

At the end of the project, it is hoped that an implementation of the popular tic-tac-toe game shall be rendered. this game shall:
- let you play tic-tac-toe
- indicate when a player has won the game
- store a game's history, as the game progresses
- allow players to review a game's history and see previous versions of the game's board
- give me a decent grasp of how React works.

Throughout the project, the building blocks of React waas learnt. This included:
- passing data through props
- making interactive components
- React Developer Tools 
- state, useState hook
- Immutability
- list keys
